## Key Classes
### TemplateApi
This class provides functions to which one can pass the template form or string (the parameters to be populated in the PDF) along with the template resource which can be in the form of .io.vm files or strings. Internally this class makes use of the VelocityUtil and FopUtil to process the data. The template files are written using the XSL-FO ( XSL Formatting Objects formatter) which is then interpreted by the Apacheâ„¢ FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) which is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree and renders the resulting pages to a specified output.

```java
public static <T> void getPdfFromVm(String templateResource, T form, OutputStream os)

public static <T> void getPdfFromString(String templateString, T form, OutputStream os)
```
